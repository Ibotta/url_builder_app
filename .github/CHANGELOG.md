## 3.0.1

Bumping the version in the manifest to match our `package.json` version.  Also rolling in some dependabot updates.

## Changes from V2 to V3 (2023)

This version of the app used the Zendesk app scaffolds to generate a Node 18 project.  We updated the app from the scaffold and updated, deprecated, or added dependencies as needed to recreate functionality.

## Changes from V1 to V2 (2019)

Zendesk moved to a new API version in 2019, and deprecated the original version of this app.  Ibotta uses Zendesk and heavily used the original app, and so it was forked and updated.
