## How to contribute to the URL Builder App V2

### Pull Requests
When making a pull request, be sure the merging repo is `ibotta/url_builder_app` and not `zendesklabs/url_builder_app`!

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/ibotta/url_builder_app/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/ibotta/url_builder_app/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change as a new issue and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

## Build Instructions

`npm run package` - This will build the `dist` folder locally after `validate` has passed.  `dist/tmp` will contain the ZIP you need to upload your version of the app.

### Testing changes in Sandbox/Production using ZAT Server

Zendesk Apps Tools is a command-line tool offered by Zendesk to create, test, validate and build Zendesk Apps.  It is also used to test local changes on your Zendesk page in sandbox or production.  You can find out more [in the Apps Developer Guide](https://developer.zendesk.com/apps/docs/developer-guide/zat)
